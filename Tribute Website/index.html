                    <h2>Missile man of India</h2>
                    <p><strong>Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR </strong> (15
                        October 1931 –
                        27 July 2015) was an Indian
                        aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th
                        president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                        raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
                        aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as
                        a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
                        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was
                        intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
                        and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
                        came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
                        work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                        vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal
                        organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                        Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
                        original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
